# Introduction

This package enables target-agnostic layout operations using the CSS flexbox algorithm.

It implements Python bindings for [Stretch](https://vislyhq.github.io/stretch/), an implementation of Flexbox written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The project is based on the translation of the bindings from Swift to Python, from [stretched](https://github.com/nmichlo/stretched)
